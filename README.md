### peanutFoam ###
peanutFoam - peanuFoam is a finite volume solver for the evolution of vesicles. 
The advected Cahn-Hilliard equation describes how the bending energy of the
vesicle relaxes with high order diffusion and advection. The system is coupled
to hydrodynamics, specifically Navier-Stokes with additional terms, standing for inextensibility.


### What is this repository for? ###

peanutFoam is compatible with OpenFOAM 6


### How do I get set up? ###

To get setup, you must first install OpenFOAM 6,
details of which can be found on the OpenFOAM Wiki at:
https://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Installation

Once OpenFOAM 6 has been installed, download peanutFoam
and then run the enclosed `wmake` script to compile peanutFoam.

Notes:

  1. the `master` branch compiles with OpenFOAM 6.
